# AirbnbNYC
Airbnb in NYC Project (Final Project of Spring 2020 GR 5291 at Columbia University)

## Abstract

Airbnb, founded in August 2008 in San Francisco, is the most popular online marketplace for renting and booking primarily home-stays and tourism experiences nowadays. And New York City, as the most populous city in the United States, also leads the pack as the most expensive city. Smart Pricing is one of the machine learning models of Airbnb, which suggests an appropriate price after a client has entered the rental details. It can also adjust the price automatically based on the changes in demand for similar listings. Our project's goal is to do an exploratory data analysis on Airbnb in New York City (2019) and explore metrics that build the Smart Pricing Model by multiple linear regression.
